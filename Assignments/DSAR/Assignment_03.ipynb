    "### 3. What is the difference between security and surveillance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.** Surveillance cameras use digital signals to transmit recorded video to a NVR via a single cable, eliminating the need for multiple power cables. Security cameras, however, require cabling to transmit video feeds to a limited number of monitors, and the cameras must be strategically placed in a single location."
