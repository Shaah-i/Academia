    "### 1.Explain the term machine learning, and how does it work? Explain two machine learning applications in the business world. What are some of the ethical concerns that machine learning applications could raise?\n",

    "**Ans.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is an AI technique that teaches computers to learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model. The algorithms adaptively improve their performance as the number of samples available for learning increases. Deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning uses two types of techniques: supervised learning, which trains a model on known input and output data so that it can predict future outputs, and unsupervised learning, which finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data.\n",

    "**Ans.** The processes of Human learning are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Under the supervision of experts`**: Human-guided machine learning is a process whereby subject matter experts accelerate the learning process by teaching the technology in real-time. For example, if the machine learning model comes across a piece of data it is uncertain about, a human can be asked to weigh in and give feedback. The model then learns from this input, and uses it to make a more accurate prediction the next time. Human-guided machine learning works from the bottom up by first using algorithms to conduct the heavy lifting of identifying relationships within the data, and engaging humans when necessary for training or validation Concept Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`With the assistance of experts in an indirect manner`**: Well The process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance Operant Conditioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Self education`**: Ability to recognize patterns, learn from data, and become more intelligent over time (can be AI or programmatically based).Machine Learning: AI systems with ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed via training Hebbian Learning."

    "### 6. Is machine learning capable of solving all problems? Give a detailed explanation of your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.** Machine Learning probably can run into all problems for solving but lays down with some concerns which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Ethics`**: The idea of trusting data and algorithms more than our own judgment has its pros and cons.Obviously, we benefit from these algorithms, otherwise, we wouldn’t be using them in the first place. These algorithms allow us to automate processes by making informed judgments using available data. Sometimes, however, this means replacing someone’s job with an algorithm, which comes with ethical ramifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Deterministic Problem`**: Machine learning is stochastic, not deterministic. A neural network does not understand Newton’s second law, or that density cannot be negative — there are no physical constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Lack of Data`**: Many machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data before they begin to give useful results."
