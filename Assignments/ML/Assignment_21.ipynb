    "### 1. What is the estimated depth of a Decision Tree trained (unrestricted) on a one million instance training set?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.** The depth of a well-balanced binary tree containing m leaves is equal to log2(m), rounded up. A binary Decision Tree (one that makes only binary decisions, as is the case of all trees in Scikit-Learn) will end up more or less well balanced at the end of training, with one leaf per training instance if it is trained without restrictions. Thus, if the training set contains one million instances, the Decision Tree will have a depth of log2\n",

    "**Ans.** A node's Gini impurity is generally lower than its parent's. This is ensured by the CART training algorithm's cost function, which splits each node in a way that minimizes the weighted sum of its children's Gini impurities. However, if one child is smaller than the other, it is possible for it to have a higher Gini impurity than its parent, as long as this increase is more than compensated for by a\n",

    "**Ans.** The computational complexity of training a Decision Tree is O(n × m log(m)). So if you multiply the training set size by 10, the training time will be multiplied by K = (n × 10m × log(10m)) / (n × m × log(m)) = 10 × log(10m) / log(m). If m = 10^6, then K ≈ 11.7, so you can expect the training time to be roughly 11.7 hours."
