    "\n",
    "**Ans.** Machine Learning is an AI technique that teaches computers to learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model."

    "+ **Computer Vision** :  Computer vision is one of the most common applications of machine learning. It is used to identify text, objects, people, place, things etc. The popular usecase is grouping images according to type e.g. sky, landscape, indoor, sea etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "+ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** :  While viewing a foreign site we usually get an option to translate the page to local language, this comes under NLP. In this the process of converting understanding the content sentiment and converting it into local language with same sentiments is done. It is used by almost all sites.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ans.** You split up the data containing known response variable values into two pieces. The training set is used to train the algorithm, and then we use the trained model on the test set to predict the response variable values that are already known. This is done to evaluate the model properly and helps us understand the data properly."

We often use a cost function or similar to determine what the parameter value has to be in order to minimise the function. The model makes predictions by using the value of the new instance and the parameter in the functions."
