    "### 1. Provide an example of the concepts of Prior, Posterior, and Likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.** The Bayes rule can be expressed in many forms. The simplest one is in terms of odds. The idea is to take the odds for something happening (against it not happening), which we'll write as prior odds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word prior refers to our assessment of the odds before obtaining some new information that may be relevant. The purpose of the formula is to update the prior odds when new information becomes available, to obtain the posterior odds, or the odds after obtaining the information (the dictionary meaning of posterior is \"something that comes after, later.)\"\n",
    "The likelihood ratio is the probability of the observation in case the event of interest, divided by the probability of the observation in case of no event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: the odds that it will rain later today. Imagine getting up in the morning in Finland. The chances of rain are 206 in 365, so prior odds = 206:159.\n",
    "Suppose the chances of having a cloudy morning on a rainy day are 9 out of 10 - that means that only one out of 10 rainy days start out with blue skies. The chances of clouds are nine times higher on a rainy day than on a rainless day.\n",
    "Likelihood ratio = (9/10) / (1/10) = 9\n",
    "BAYES RULE\n",
    "The Bayes rule for converting prior odds into posterior odds as follows:\n",
    "posterior odds = likelihood ratio × prior odds\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex.:\n",
    "Prior odds = 206:159\n",
    "Likelihood odds = 9\n",
    "Posterior odds = 206:159 × 9 = 1854:159\n"

    "### 2. What role does Bayes' theorem play in the concept learning principle?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.** Bayes Theorem is also used widely in machine learning, where it is a simple, effective way to predict classes with precision and accuracy. The Bayesian method of calculating conditional probabilities is used in machine learning applications that involve classification tasks.Bayes theorem helps us to calculate the single term P(B|A) in terms of P(A|B), P(B), and P(A). This rule is very helpful in such scenarios where we have a good probability of P(A|B), P(B), and P(A) and need to determine the fourth term.Bayes' Theorem allows you to update the predicted probabilities of an event by incorporating new information. Bayes' Theorem was named after 18th-century mathematician Thomas Bayes. It is often employed in finance in calculating or updating risk evaluation."

    "\n",
    "**Ans.** Real time Prediction: Naive Bayes is an eager learning classifier and it is sure fast. Thus, it could be used for making predictions in real time. Multi class Prediction: This algorithm is also well known for multi class prediction feature. Here we can predict the probability of multiple classes of target variable."

    "\n",
    "**Ans.** How do we perform classification using Naive Bayes when the data we have is continuous in nature. If an instance in test data set has a category that was not present during training then it will assign it “Zero” probability and won't be able to make prediction. This is known as Zero frequency problem.Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ans.** It can also be used in various tasks including prediction, anomaly detection, diagnostics, automated insight, reasoning, time series prediction, and decision making under uncertainty. Bayesian Network can be used for building models from data and experts opinions, and it consists of two parts: Directed Acyclic Graph.Bayesian networks are a widely-used class of probabilistic graphical models. They consist of two parts: a structure and parameters. The structure is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that expresses conditional independencies and dependencies among ran- dom variables associated with nodes."
