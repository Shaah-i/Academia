    "### 1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans.** `def` is a normal function while `lambda` is an anonymus function. The lambda function is very versatile as it can be assigned to a variable and can be called anytime using the variable. It is a single statment while def function contains a block of statments. As lambda statment is a single line function we don't need to return anything and is limited to small function unlike def."

    "\n",
    "**Ans.** The differences between map, filter and reduce are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. map(): The map() function makes an iterator that computes the function using arguments from each of the iterables.  Stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted.\n",
    "2. filter(): The filter() returns an iterator yielding those items of iterable for which function (item) is true. If function is None, returns the items that are true.\n",
    "3. reduce(): The reduce() function applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequenc or iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value."

    "1. Avoid use of global variables\n",

    "4. Name the function with actual purpose of the function e.g. isPrime() will tell if a number is prime or not.\n",
    "5. Use docstring to explain the working/ application of the function\n",
    "6. Use proper indentation for code readability and bug identification.\n",
    "7. Can use all uppercase for constants e.g. LIMIT = 100 (Python doesnâ€™t have built-in constant types and hence this convention helps identify and not change its value)"
