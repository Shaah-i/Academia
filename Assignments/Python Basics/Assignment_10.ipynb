    "\n",
    "**Ans.**\n",
    "`shutil.copy()` method is used to copy the content of file from source to destination file or directory. No metadata like creation and modification time is not preserved but the permission mode is preserved. If source and destination are the same file, a SameFileError will be raised.\n",

It will be created during copying. Permissions, creation and modification time of directories are copied with copystat() and individual files are copied using shutil.copy2()."
